		<p class="indent">Hello and thank you for stopping by our website! I’m Pooja Mahajan, the lucky owner of Taste Of Happiness. Back in 1997, Taste Of Happiness began as a modest mail-order bakery. This was before I even knew they existed!</p>
		<p class="indent">Well, a few years later…<br>
		I happened to visit this bakery to buy a cake for my friend's birthday. The rest, as they say, is history… it was definitely love at first bite, and I ended up buying the business!</p><img src="images/c10.png" width="300" height="200">
		<p class="indent">Since then, I’ve updated the look and feel of the company to reflect our team’s fun, whimsical personality. We’ve also added custom designs. But there’s one thing that we’ve kept the same… and it’s the wholesome, homemade recipes that I fell in love with in the first place.</p>
		<p class="indent">To us, cake isn’t just a dessert. It’s a symbol of celebration, happiness, friends and family. That’s why we take so much care in creating the most splendid and delectable cakes and cupcakes… because we know what it means to you.</p>
		<p class="indent">We’re a small team.<br>
		But we kind of like it that way. It allows us to make sure that each cake is handmade, hand decorated and beautifully packaged. In fact, Oprah loved our Key Lime Bundt Cake so much that she named it one of Oprah’s Favorite Things! Soon after, Taste Of Happiness appeared on three different Food Network Shows.</p>

		<p class="indent">We Take the Cake featured in CNN Money MagazineWe Take the Cake Featured in The Miami HeraldWe Take the Cake featured in Entrepreneur MagazineWe Take the Cake featured in InStyle Magazine</p>
		<p class="indent">We’re quite proud of our achievements.<br>
		And strive to make sure we keep up the good work year after year as we continue to craft each cake by hand using only the finest all-natural ingredients. We are proud to include among our customers nationally recognized caterers, party planners, private clubs, world-famous hotels and exclusive resorts. We are prouder still that those customers who first found us in 1997 continue to insist that we simply make the best cakes anywhere.</p>
